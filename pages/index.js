              Park Circle Skate is a group of community members and businesses
              in the Park Circle area of North Charleston who are advocating for
              a free-to-use, safe, and inclusive concrete skatepark for our
              community.

              Park Circle residents have access to a variety of recreational
              spaces with many being renovated to offer the best facilities to
              the deserving community. However, one important activity that is
              an athletic sport, art form, and lifestyle has been overlooked by
              city planning, and that is skateboarding.

              You can easily find baseball fields, basketball hoops, and tennis
              courts in most U.S. cities and towns but many of these same places
              do not offer anywhere for skaters to legally skate, much less a
              skatepark. Skaters in these areas are forced to ride in dangerous
              roadways, sidewalks, or parking lots where they will more than
              likely be kicked out by local authorities. &quot;[Skaters] show an
              uncommon dedication to their sport. And what does this commitment
              to physical exercise and outdoor activity earn them? In many areas
              it gets them a big fine.&quot; (

                A local skatepark provides a safe place for people to practice
                their sport and challenge themselves in a healthy way. Skaters
                encourage each other to push beyond what they think is possible.
                A skater can spend hours/days/weeks trying a new trick and
                perfecting it. This persistance teaches them valuable lessons
                that transfer over to other aspects of life.

                In addition to a sport, skateboarding is also considered to be a
                lifestyle and an art form. It can provide a sense of
                individuality and a means for artistic expression for our youth.
                Few sports give the individual participant complete creative
                control, and it is through the process of self-discovery and
                testing one&apos;s limits that a skater can develop his or her
                own style.
